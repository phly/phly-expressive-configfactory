## 1.0.0 - 2019-02-06

### Added

- Creates `Phly\Expressive\ConfigFactory`, which can be used to retrieve nested
  values from the `config` service. As an example, given the configuration:

  ```php
  return [
      'cache' => [
          'adapters' => [
              'blog' => [
                  'connection' => 'tcp://localhost:6349',
                  'username'   => 'www-data',
                  'prefix'     => 'blog',
              ],
          ],
      ],
  ];
  ```

  a factory could pull the "blog" adapter information using:

  ```php
  $container->get('config-cache.adapters.blog');
  ```
